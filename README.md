# house_rocket_challenge
The challenge is a simulation of a digital platform whose business model is the purchase and sale of real estate. I'm taking the role of a data scientist hired to help find the best opportunities in the real estate market.  My main strategy is to buy good houses with great locations and low price and then resell them later with higher prices. So my job as a data scientist is answer the following questions:  Which houses should de CEO of House Rocket buy and a what purchase price?  Once the house is owned by the company, what's the best moment to sell it and what would be the sale price?  The House Rocket should do some renovation to increase the sale price? What would be the suggestions for changes? What is the increase in the price given for each renovation option?  What's the ideal house's profile based on average price and frequency?
